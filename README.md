## Admin Panel

In the admin panel, there are two roles: admin and user. The admin role has full access and control over the website's content and settings. The admin can make changes to user details, manage the banner, upload or update videos, news, and photos in the gallery. Additionally, the admin has the authority to modify information related to equipment and regiments. The admin panel also includes an IP tracker feature, which allows the admin to track and monitor the interactions of users with different sections of the website. This feature enables the admin to gain insights into user engagement and behavior.

## Front End

This section may include an overview of the Ministry of Defence, its mission, and key initiatives. It can also feature news updates, announcements, and highlights related to the armed forces.

2. Regiment: The Regiment page showcases information about various Indian regiments. It provides details about different regiments, their history, achievements, and notable contributions to the defense of the nation. This section may include images, videos, and textual descriptions to offer comprehensive insights into each regiment.

3. Equipment: The Equipment page presents a comprehensive list of the equipment used by the armed forces. It categorizes the equipment into different sections such as vehicles, weapons, airforce, and navy.
